# ChinchillaCam
A Raspberry Pi webcam to find what's living under our front porch - we suspect it's at least one chinchilla.

I've just started this project; there is much to do.

The essential hardware consists of a Raspberry Pi 3 and Camera Module V2. The software uses OpenCV (Open Computer Vision, a huge and powerful image processing library) and Python. The idea is to continuously capture frames from the camera, use software motion-detection, and upload any frame that has (the right) motion in it.

* TO DO: write the software :-)
