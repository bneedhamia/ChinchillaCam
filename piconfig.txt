Configuration of my Raspberry Pi 3 for Python, Wifi, Camera development
Brad Needham

Install the Camera Module V2 hardware:
See https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/
and https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-picamera/worksheet/
Using the two screws that came with the Pi Enclosure, fasten the camera to the enclosure.
Pull up gently on the Pi board camera connector (a thin rectangular connector).
Insert the camera ribbon cable into the camera connector - pay attention to the direction
shown in the pictures on the getting-started page.
Gently push the connector down. This clamps the ribbon cable.
Close the Pi Enclosure, arranging the ribbon cable so it isn't pinched.

Install Raspbian:
Install Noobs on a 16GB MiniSD card for the Pi:
  See https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/
  I formatted the card on Windows using SDFormatter from the SD Association,
  (https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/)
  using Quick Format and Format Size Adjustment.
Connect the Pi to an HDMI monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
Connect the Pi to power.
Select Raspbian.
Click WiFi and choose the hotspot to connect to and its password.
Click Install (this will take a few minutes).
Wait for Raspbian to install and reboot.
Once it reboots, it will come up as a graphical interface, auto-logged in as pi.

Setup Raspberry Preferences:
menu / preferences / Raspberry Pi Configuration...
Select the Localisation tab
 Locale: USA English
 Timezone: US Pacific
 Keyboard: US English
 WiFi: US
 Click OK
Agree to reboot.

Secure your Pi against default-password attacks:
Choose a password for root and pi users.
$ sudo passwd
Enter your chosen root password (twice).
$ passwd
Enter the default user pi password ("raspberry" without the quotes).
Enter your chosen pi password (twice).

Choose a unique Host name for this pi so it won't be confused with others on your network.
menu / preferences / Raspberry Pi Configuration...
Select the System tab
 Hostname: Enter your chosen hostname
 Click OK
 Agree to reboot.

(Re)Setup the Wifi:
Click the networking icon: the two-screen icon in the upper right of the screen.
Wait for it to scan for Access points.
Click on the one you want to connect to.
Enter the password for that WiFi access point.
Wait for the WiFi icon to appear, then wait for that icon to become steady (vs. blinking).

Force update of the date and time, so that network browsing will work:
$ sudo ntpd -qg
Double-check that the date and time in the upper-right of the screen is now correct.
Open the Web Browser (earth and pointer icon) and check that you can view www.google.com
 Don't worry about any Upgrade messages from Chrome; we'll fix that later.

Upgrade to the latest versions of software:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade (this will take a few minutes)

Enable and test the camera module:
menu / preferences / Raspberry Pi Configuration...
Choose the Interfaces tab.
Enable the Camera (click on the button labeled "Enabled").
Click OK
Agree to Reboot your Pi.

Set up git and clone the ChinchillaCam repository:
$ git config --global user.name "your name"    (use your first and last name)
$ git config --global user.email yourEmail@wherever  (use your email address)
$ cd Documents
$ git clone https://github.com/bneedhamia/ChinchillaCam.git

Follow the instructions at https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-picamera/worksheet/
menu / preferences / Raspberry Pi Configuration...
Select the Interfaces tab.
Enable the camera (click the text "enabled" to turn on that option).
Click OK
Agree to reboot.

Enable SSH so you can remotely access the Pi if you wish:
$ sudo raspi-config
Down-arrow to "Interfacing Options"
Press the Enter key
Down-Arrow to "SSH"
Press the Enter key
In the resulting dialog, left-arrow to highlight Yes, then press Enter
Press Enter again
Right-arrow until Finish is selected, then press Enter
Reboot

Install OpenCV and its Python connections by following the instructions at
http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/04/18/install-guide-raspberry-pi-3-raspbian-jessie-opencv-3/

Install the PiCamera & PiCamera Array Python libraries so Python can read camera frames into OpenCV:
$ pip install "picamera[array]"
